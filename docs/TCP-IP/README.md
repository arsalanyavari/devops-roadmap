### In the context of DevOps, understanding TCP/IP is important because it underlies the communication protocols used throughout the Internet and network systems. The sections we are going to talk about include the following list:


- [ ] Network configuration: DevOps engineers must understand TCP/IP protocols, addressing, subnetting, and routing to configure network devices like routers, switches, and firewalls. They also need to know how to troubleshoot network connectivity issues.
  - TCP/IP protocols
    - Internet Protocol (IP)
    - Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)
    - User Datagram Protocol (UDP)
    - Address Resolution Protocol (ARP)
    - Domain Name System (DNS)
    - Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP)
    - Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP)
    - File Transfer Protocol (FTP)
    - Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)
    - Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)/Transport Layer Security (TLS)
    - Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP)
    - Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP)
  - addressing
  - subnetting
  - routing to configure network devices
    - routers
    - switches
    - firewalls
  - network troubleshooting connectivity issues

- [ ] Application deployment: DevOps engineers need to understand how applications communicate over TCP/IP protocols to deploy and configure them correctly. They must be able to set up load balancing, configure SSL certificates, and ensure the proper use of DNS names.
  - load balancing
  - configure SSL certificates
  - DNS

- [ ] TCP vs. UDP: These are two different transport protocols used in TCP/IP. TCP provides reliable, ordered, and error-checked delivery of data, while UDP provides faster but less reliable delivery. DevOps teams may need to choose which protocol to use depending on the specific needs of their applications.

- [ ] Ports: Ports are used to specify which application or service should receive incoming network traffic. DevOps teams may need to open or close ports as  part of configuring firewalls or other security measures.

- [ ] Monitoring: DevOps engineers must have knowledge of TCP/IP to monitor network traffic and detect anomalies or security threats. They must be able to use tools like Wireshark and tcpdump to analyze network traffic.

- [ ] Security: DevOps engineers must have knowledge of TCP/IP to implement security measures like firewalls and access control lists. They must be able to understand how attacks like denial-of-service (DoS) and distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) work to prevent them.
