# Network Protocols
Just as we humans have defined actions to communicate contractually, in the network world there are also contracts for communication between devices and sending packets, which are called protocols.
For example, people greet each other at the beginning of a conversation and then start talking. In the network, according to the need and the desired protocol, actions must be taken so that two devices can communicate with each other under the format of a protocol. It should be noted that a violation of the principles and rules of the protocols leads to the loss of connection between two devices.
In the below picture, we have compared the way of human communication with one of the network protocols (TCP).

Protocols define how data is transmitted over the network, how errors are detected and corrected, and how devices establish and terminate connections. Various protocols such as TCP/IP, HTTP, FTP and SMTP are used in the network. Each protocol has its own purpose and set of rules for how to transmit and receive data.
You can see the list of all network level protocols in the image below. It should be noted that there is no need to know all of them, and those that are necessary will be explained. You can see the High quality version of image by clicking on it.
