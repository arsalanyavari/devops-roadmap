# Python String Formatting

**From the Python 3 documentation**
The formatting operations described here (% operator) exhibit a variety of quirks that lead to a number of common errors [...]. Using the newer formatted string literals [...] helps avoid these errors. These alternatives also provide more powerful, flexible and extensible approaches to formatting text.
## % operator
**Prefer String Literals**
For new code, using str.format, or formatted string literals (Python 3.6+) over the `%` operator is strongly recommended.
```python
>>> name = 'Pete'
>>> 'Hello %s' % name
# "Hello Pete"
```
We can use the `%x` format specifier to convert an int value to a string:
```python
>>> num = 5
>>> 'I have %x apples' % num
# "I have 5 apples"
```
## str.format
Python 3 introduced a new way to do string formatting that was later back-ported to Python 2.7. This makes the syntax for string formatting more regular.
```python
>>> name = 'John'
>>> age = 20'

>>> "Hello I'm {}, my age is {}".format(name, age)
# "Hello I'm John, my age is 20"

>>> "Hello I'm {0}, my age is {1}".format(name, age)
# "Hello I'm John, my age is 20"
```

If your are using Python 3.6+, string `f-strings` are the recommended way to format strings.

From the Python 3 documentation
A formatted string literal or f-string is a string literal that is prefixed with `f` or `F`. These strings may contain replacement fields, which are expressions delimited by curly braces {}. While other string literals always have a constant value, formatted strings are really expressions evaluated at run time.
```python
>>> name = 'Elizabeth'
>>> f'Hello {name}!'
# 'Hello Elizabeth!'
```
It is even possible to do inline arithmetic with it:
```python
>>> a = 5
>>> b = 10
>>> f'Five plus ten is {a + b} and not {2 * (a + b)}.'
# 'Five plus ten is 15 and not 30.'
```
## Formatting Digits
Adding thousands separator
```python
>>> a = 10000000
>>> f"{a:,}"
# '10,000,000'
```
Rounding
```python
>>> a = 3.1415926
>>> f"{a:.2f}"
# '3.14'
```
Showing as Percentage
```python
>>> a = 0.816562
>>> f"{a:.2%}"
# '81.66%'
```
## Number formatting table
| Number     | Format  | Output    | description                                  |
|   :---:    |  :---:  |   :---:   |              :---:                           |
| 3.1415926  | {:.2f}  | 3.14      | Format float 2 decimal places                |
| 3.1415926  | {:+.2f} | +3.14     | Format float 2 decimal places with sign      |
| -1         | {:+.2f} | -1.00     | Format float 2 decimal places with sign      |
| 2.71828    | {:.0f}  | 3         | Format float with no decimal places          |
| 4          | {:0>2d} | 04        | Pad number with zeros (left padding, width 2) |
| 4          | {:x<4d} | 4xxx      | Pad number with x’s (right padding, width 4) |
| 10         | {:x<4d} | 10xx      | Pad number with x’s (right padding, width 4) |
| 1000000    | {:,}    | 1,000,000 | Number format with comma separator           |
| 0.35       | {:.2%}  | 35.00%    | Format percentage                            |
| 1000000000 | {:.2e}  | 1.00e+09  | Exponent notation                            |
| 11         | {:11d}  | 11        | Right-aligned (default, width 10)            |
| 11         | {:<11d} | 11        | Left-aligned (width 10)                      |
| 11         | {:^11d} | 11        | Center aligned (width 10)                    |

## Template Strings
A simpler and less powerful mechanism, but it is recommended when handling strings generated by users. Due to their reduced complexity, template strings are a safer choice.
```python
>>> from string import Template
>>> name = 'Elizabeth'
>>> t = Template('Hey $name!')
>>> t.substitute(name=name)
# 'Hey Elizabeth!'
```
